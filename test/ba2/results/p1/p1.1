The following prompt consists of a Task Description and a Task Input.

Task Description:
- The Task input is a Gherkin Specifiction describing a feature with multiple Scenarios. Each Scenario contains steps
- The Task Output should use the framework cucumber to implement the steps for each scenario. The test-cases should be implemented using the framework playwright
- Steps should not be duplicated if variables are used in the specification
- Output only code, without description
- Comment code using jsdoc
- testIds should contain the component and purpose in lowerCamelCase style but not the type of element like button or input
- the baseURL is 'http://localhost:3000/'


Task Input:
Feature: Login
    In order to save created data and to load it if accessed on another device
    As a user
    I want the possibility to sign up and/or sign into the application with an email and password
    The Login form should therefore be the first thing that is shown.
    The possiblity to continue anonymously by closing the login form should also be possible.

    Scenario: Initial visibility of the login component
        Given the user opens the application
        Then the signIn component with username and passowrd should be visible
